    :param goal: The goal of the motion, which can be given in joint (list of float, in the order of active joints in
        the planning group) or Cartesian space (geometry_msgs/Pose).

    :note:
        The geometry_msgs/Pose consists of position and orientation (quaternion). When creating an instance of
        geometry_msgs/Pose, the position and orientation can be left as uninitialized. The uninitialized position is
        considered as zero position. The uninitialized orientation is considered as keeping the current orientation
        unchanged. This difference is because uninitialized position can not be recognized when comparing with a zero
        position but uninitialized orientation can.

    :param planning_group: Name of the planning group, default as "manipulator".

    :param target_link: Name of the target link if Cartesian goal is given, default as "prbt_tcp"

    :param relative: Has to be set to:

            * :py:obj:`False` if the goal states the target position as absolute position with regard to base coordinate
                              system.
            * :py:obj:`True` if the goal states the target position as offset relative to the current robot position.

            The orientation is added as offset to the euler-angles.
            The offset has to be stated with regard to the base coordinate system.
            E.g. to move the robot 0.1m up and tilt it 10degrees around the global z-axis use:
            ::

                Ptp(goal=Pose(position=Point(0., 0., 0.1), orientation=from_euler(math.radians(10), 0., 0.)),
                    vel_scale=0.4)


            Note the gimbal lock, if you pass a relative rotation to this function: If b==0, the values for a and c
            depend on each other and may thus give arbitrary euler angles, when converting back from quaternion to
            euler internally.
            The function assumes, you want to take the shorter rotation distance, so you should only pass
            rotations smaller than 180 degrees for relative movements.

    :param reference_frame: The frame of reference parameter allows to change the reference coordinate system for the
        passed goal position and orientation.
        Any published tf can be used as frame by reference. The reference_frame has to be a valid tf id string.
        Setting no reference_frame will use "prbt_base" as default.
