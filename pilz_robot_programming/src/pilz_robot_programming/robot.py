class Robot(object):
    """
    Main component of the API which allows the user to execute robot motion commands and pause, resume or stop the
    execution. The following commands are currently supported:

    * :py:class:`.Ptp`
    * :py:class:`.Lin`
    * :py:class:`.Circ`
    * :py:class:`.Sequence`
    * :py:class:`.Gripper`

    For a more detailed description of the individual commands please see the documentation of
    the corresponding command. Especially see the documentation of the `pilz_industrial_motion_planner` package
    to get more information on additional parameters that can be configured in the MoveIt! plugin.

    The commands are executed with the help of Moveit.

    :note:
        To any given time only one instance of the Robot class is allowed to exist.

    :note:
        Before you create an instance of :py:class:`.Robot`, ensure that MoveIt is up and running,
        because the constructor blocks until all necessary connections to Moveit are established.
        Currently connections to the following topics have to be established before the function
        finishes:

        * move_group
        * sequence_move_group

    :note:
        Currently the API does not support creating a new instance of :py:class:`.Robot` after deleting an old one in
        the same program. However this can be realized by calling :py:meth:`_release` before the deletion.

    :param version:
        To ensure that always the correct API version is used, it is necessary to state
        which version of the API is expected. If the given version does not match the
        version of the underlying API then an exception is thrown. Only the major version number
        is considered.

    :raises RobotVersionError: if the given version string does not match the module version.
    :raises RobotMultiInstancesError: if an instance of Robot class already exists.
